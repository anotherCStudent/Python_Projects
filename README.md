# Sals_Shipping_trrauts
This is my first code. Instead of following the steps on Codecademy, I read the general instructions and wrote the code myself from line 1 without any help, meaning I didn't need to follow the steps.
To use the program insert your package weight into the "weight" section, then run the program. It will output the three diffrent methods of shipping along with the diffrent costs assoicated. That way the buyer can make an informed decision on what the cheapest shipping method is.
